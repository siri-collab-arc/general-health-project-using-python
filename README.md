# 🏥 General Hospital – Heart Disease Prediction

## 📖 Description
This project is based on a **General Hospital scenario** where patient health data is analyzed to predict the presence of heart disease.  
Using **Machine Learning models**, the system helps in identifying patients at risk and supports doctors in decision-making.
